# FD-Calculator: Your Financial Planning Assistant
An FD calculator is a digital tool that helps you estimate the potential returns on a fixed deposit (FD) investment.

# How it works? You input the following information into the calculator:
Principal amount: The amount you plan to invest.
Interest rate: The interest rate offered by the bank or financial institution.
Tenure: The duration of the fixed deposit.

# The calculator then processes this information and provides you with:
Maturity amount: The total amount you will receive at the end of the FD term. Â 

# Why use an FD calculator?
Quick calculations: Avoid complex manual calculations.
Compare options: Evaluate different FD options based on interest rates and tenures.
Financial planning: Helps in setting financial goals and making informed decisions.
